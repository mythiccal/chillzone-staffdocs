# Staff Commands

## Intro

_This only applies to helpers & mods_

Most staff won't have the ability to delete messages - this is intentional. Discord has no way to limit what messages you can delete, therefore I can't allow new staff members to be able to wipe out important announcements, info, etc.

Therefore - if you encounter a situation where a member has bypassed a filter somehow, potentially sending something such as a gore image - please just tag a higher staff member (like owner or co-owner), usually @myth or @damien.&#x20;

**ADMINS** : You will have the ability to ban someone via @dyno bot, simply just do your ban command and that should delete their bad message along with them.

**Please also never ban/kick/mute someone for fun or as a joke, it'll often result in irreversible consequences such as all of their previous messages being wiped, etc. This will also probably result in you being demoted/kicked.**

## Helper

You guys have very limited permissions, you can simply time out members.&#x20;

Simply right-click on a user and select timeout, then select your time (usually 1H).&#x20;

Only use this if there's someone spamming and you're the first person on the case.

## Commands

**The prefix to every command is** `*`**, and the moderation bot is Dyno.**

**Optional fields are marked by { } - Mandatory Fields are marked by \[ ]**

_Reasons are technically optional but please always provide one - it just makes appeals & everything much simpler._

* ban {noappeal} \[@user] {time} \[reason]
* unban \[userid] \[reason]
* mute \[@user] {time} \[reason]
* unmute \[userid] \[reason]
* kick \[@user] \[reason]

## Emergency:

only available to high staff - owner, co-owner, supervisor

only to be used in an absolute emergency, like a raid, will lock down all channels.

* lockdown \[reason]
* lockdown end&#x20;

## End

That's all, if I'm missing anything or you have any queries, just ask in #staff-chat and I'll let you know & add to this document.
