# Player Applications

Players will firstly create an application and it'll show up in a ticket on Discord, in which you will be pinged:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Reviewing the applications is pretty simple

* Quickly read their reason for joining, if it's **acceptable** then you run the command below.
* If their reason for joining isn't acceptable (like "I WANT TO GRIEF" or something like that, where you can clearly see they're just there to troll) then just let them know their application is denied.
* If their reason is blank, just request they provide it in the channel.

If everything is good, you have two commands to run :&#x20;

1. `*whitelist <@user>`  - This just applies their role to access the whitelist channel. All staff should have perms to do this, let me know if you have issues and I'll fix your perms.
2. `/tag tag:application approved for:<@user>` - **This is a slash command**, it'll be easier if you just type /tag and then select the options. There should only be one tag option of "Application Approved", and then you simply just **select the player who applied** for the **"For" bit**.&#x20;
